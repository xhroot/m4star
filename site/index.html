          Below you'll find a download link for the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> chat app as well as another link to join your discord with our <a href="https://discord.gg/KfcFeFTmpf">Clan channel</a>. We encourage your participation. 
          </h5>
          <h5>
          MCRN4star clan is over a year old. It was founded by <code>M4*beaverSTYLE</code> and M4*xhroot. We are a five time legendary clan. We pride ourselves on being friendly, and team oriented.  We're a largely North American clan but with representation from several countries globally. We've reached 789th on the leaderboard not long ago. Aiming for top 500 or higher now. 
          </h5>
          <h5>
          We have recently expanded to 130 member capacity as we have a second Legendary clan.
          </h5>

          <h5>
          With our new 2 clan system: 
          <ul>
          <li>MCRN4star is our highly competitive roster.</li>
          <li>MCRN is competitive and legendary as well, but has fewer requirements.</li>
          </ul>
          One must start on MCRN and earn their way onto the competitive clan. 
          </h5>

          <h5>
          To be eligible for MCRN4star, one must play with their microphone & speaker on, be on our discord, and produce more than 5000 points per week in Clan Wars. While a member, 2 weeks under 5000 and you may be eligible for invitation to MCRN 
          </h5>

          <h5>
          Requirements for MCRN are acknowledging <code>M4*beaverSTYLE</code> through in game chat or discord, and having your speaker on. 
          </h5>

          <h5>
          Many have added the "M4*" clan tag to the front of their name, though it is not required. Though it is very helpful in connecting with all of your teammates. A "Name change card" can be purchase in the store with "in game" credits. 
          </h5>


          <h5>
          We do not tolerate sexism, racism, homephobia, or any other forms of harassment. 
          </h5>

          <h5>
